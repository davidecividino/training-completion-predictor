The repo is structured as follows.

Two main files containing the analysis:
* Exploratory_Data_Analysis.Rmd: file generating the Exploratory Data Analysis and containing the information on the task details (start from here)
    The Rmd script generates the html file Exploratory_Data_Analysis.html
* model_constuction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containg the model definition, performance evaluation and discussion of results and insights in Jupyter Notebook.
    The Jupyter Notebook generates the html file model_constuction.html

One folder with all the data data/, stuctured into two subfolders:
* raw/: with the two raw datasets
* clean/: with the final cleaned dataset

A support technical folder:
* .ipynb_checkpoints
